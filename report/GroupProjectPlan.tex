\prefacesection{Abstract}

A first assessed activity will be the Group Project Plan (20\%). The
first step is to delimit the problem which will be studied. You should
understand and define your own overall problem and propose a solution.
Having only a short time to complete the project, it is crucial that the
problem that will be studied is well defined. The approach to solve the
problem should be original, so it will be necessary to carry out a
preliminary literature review. This will prevent any plagiarism. This
will also enable you to situate the project in a more global context. At
this stage, one can identify potential approaches and software that will
be used to solve the problem. It is necessary to plan any simulation
carefully and to decide what statistical analyses will have to be
carried out. All the sub-steps of the project should be planned
precisely (a detailed schedule will be created). A kind of short draft
version of your final report, consisting of a three-page proposal
(excluding the mandatory pages devoted to the title, abstract, contents
and references) will be submitted and discussed with one of the
instructors at the end of Week 1 or in a clear definition of the problem
you plan to study; a clear description of the data format and their
storage; a clear description of the relevant data (variables, missing
and corrupt values, etc.); the level of difficulty of the chosen data
sets (size, complexity, messiness) and its relevance for the chosen
problem; the appropriate choice of software and statistical methods to
solve your research questions; a clear description of the role of each
team member with a proper justification; the precision of your scheduled
activities.

\hypertarget{introduction-and-motivation}{%
\section{Introduction and
Motivation}\label{introduction-and-motivation}}

You should describe the problem in your own words and motivate its
importance. Your description should be clear for a reader not familiar
with the problem (e.g., a student in your discipline but who is not
involved in the course, another professor from your school who is not
teaching this course). The idea is that you explain clearly what you
have understood about what exactly is the problem after having listened
to the project provider, and after potential discussions with the
sponsor and/or your lecturers. Each team can define its own specific
problem in the context of the global problem and associated data sets
provided by the ``client.''

\bigskip

Then, briefly describe how you intend to solve the problem (e.g.,
compare several existing methodologies, apply specific statistical
techniques, etc.).

\hypertarget{brief-literature-review}{%
\section{Brief Literature Review}\label{brief-literature-review}}

Survey the most related work you have found in the literature. Due to
space restrictions, describe only the most relevant work and discuss its
connections to your work. Describe the methods employed in the related
work, as well as the employed measure of success.

\bigskip

In order to incorporate your own references in this report, we strongly
advise you use BibTeX. Your references then need to be recorded in the
file \texttt{references.bib}, and cited as follows {[}1{]}.

\hypertarget{methods-software-and-data-description}{%
\section{Methods, Software and Data
Description}\label{methods-software-and-data-description}}

You should describe the techniques you intend to use and why you have
selected these techniques. Also, describe the software and libraries
that you will need to implement your analyses. You can revise this later
since this is an initial proposal. Finally, provide a clear description
of the relevant data (format, storage, variables, messiness, size,
complexity) and its relevance for the chosen problem.

\hypertarget{activities-and-schedule}{%
\section{Activities and Schedule}\label{activities-and-schedule}}

List the main project activities and create a timetable for the
activities. You can use a Gantt Chart (see next page). Describe the
roles of all team members with proper justification.

\newpage

Here is an example of a Gantt chart created using \LaTeX:
