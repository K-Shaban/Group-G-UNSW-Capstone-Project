Discussion Items:
Item                             | Who      | Notes 
1. Project progress              | Dr Sarat | Advised we should have a solid model running by now and should spend the rest of time for improving and polishing.  
2. Project direction             | Dr Sarat | Should focus on the performance of the model, instead of forecasting the future as there are too many uncertainties, so not too meaningful. 
3. Model                         | Dr Sarat | Always justify the decision of modeling method. Be careful when using nurmerical dummy variables - larger number may be given more significance. Suggested to use one-hot encoding.
4. Code                          | Dr Sarat | Suggested separate notebooks for each model, but make sure the same test data is used. 
5. Clarification of report       | Dr Sarat | For each dataset, write one paragraph to describe it such as the size and variables. 
                                            | Should include one paragraph for limitation such as data availability. 
                                            | For graphs from other publishments, only use it directly when it is critical. Always cite the source.
