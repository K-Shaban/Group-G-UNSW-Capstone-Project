Discussion Items:
Item                             | Who      | Notes 
1. Feedback on Project Plan      | Dr Armin | Our mark is one of the highest. Keep up the work in the final report. 
                                            | Suggestions:
                                            |  - Always introduce the full name before using any short form. 
                                            |  - Unless it's obvious fact, for any claim, either cite or prove it. 
2. Approach to research question | Dr Armin | Suggested not to fall so specific into WFH effect as so many other factors can affect demand. 
                                            | Maybe justify why a new model is needed after covid, then develop a new model, and expand from there.
                                            | Some possible models are random forest and SARIMA. 
3. Alternative approach          | Dr Armin | Always good to keep a backup plan.
