Meeting Agenda

Date: Wednesday, 6th September 2023
Time: 6-7pm

Goal: Gain feedback on research question/approach

Discussion topics:
- Proposed research question:
  The impact of Covid-19 lockdowns and work-from-home trend on electricity demand in NSW

- Approach: 
  Isolate the effects of lockdowns, and working from home from the pre-Covid trend in the present energy demand curve. 
  In doing so we can generate valuable insights on how the persistent shift to working from home will continue to effect energy demand in the future.
  We will:
  1. Build a forecast model for demand up to 2019 (pre-Covid). 
  2. Project demand from 2019 to 2023 as if no covid happened. 
  3. Compare to actual demand in 2022-2023 to study the impact of persistant WFH style to demand.
  4. Effect of lockdowns on demand will also be analysed. 

- Questions:
  1. Can we expand the provided data set to most updated data (June 2023)?
  2. Can you give us some feedback on our chosen research question and approach?
  3. Is the scope of our question/plan good enough for the project?
  4. Suggestions for achieving high mark in this course?
