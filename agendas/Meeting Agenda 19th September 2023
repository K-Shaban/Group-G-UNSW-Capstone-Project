Meeting Agenda

Date: Tuesday, 19th September 2023
Time: 7-8pm

Goal: Gain feedback on research question/approach

Discussion topics:

1. Change of project research direction
Our initial research is about the impact of Covid-19 lockdowns and work-from-home trend on electricity demand in NSW.
After discussing with Dr Armin, he suggested it will be challenging to isolate the effect of WFH from other factors that can affect demand. He suggested that we go for a boarder research question.
Our alternative research will propose a new forecasting model that incorporate more social enconomical factors such as WFH%, interest rate and inflation, etc. post-covid. 
The overall process is as below:
 - Compare the social-economical conditions before and after covid and how it affects people’s behaviour in relation to electricity usage.
 - Compare AEMO’s forecast and actual consumption data, and find any lack of accuracy.
 - Develop a forecast model for maximum daily demand to incorporate the social-economical features (focus on residential impact) and test its performance. 
 - Extension: Forecast to 2033 (when coal power plants retired and NSW will produce 20% less electricity by coal - roadmap) with different scenarios - rooftop solar, WFH%, etc.

2. Clarification of reports
  - For data preparation part, do we need to explain for every dataset we use, or can we explain it in general? 
  - Can we use graphs directly from published reports with citations?
  - Should we include a part for limitations?
